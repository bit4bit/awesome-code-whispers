# AWESOME CODE WHISPERS

In this repository I collect the whispers that I hear in the code readings, these whispers are valuable abstractions (from the author's perspective) that deserve to be remembered and memorized

A whisper should be valuable on its own, should not need comment, and is visually explicit.
